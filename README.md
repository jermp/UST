# UST

UST is a bioinformatics tool for constructing a spectrum-preserving string set (SPSS) representation from sets of k-mers.

## Quick start

To install, compile from source:

    git clone https://github.com/jermp/UST
    cd UST
    make

After compiling, use

    ./ust -i [unitigs.fa] -k [kmer_size]

e.g.

    ./ust -i examples/k11.unitigs.fa -k 11

The important parameters are:

*  `k [int]` : The k-mer size that was used to generate the input, i.e. the length of the nodes of the node-centric de Bruijn graph.
*  `i [input-file]` : Unitigs file produced by [BCALM2 in FASTA format](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm#output).
*  `a [0 or 1]` : Default is 0. A value of 1 tells UST to preserve abundance. Use this option when the input file was generated with the  `-all-abundance-counts` option of BCALM2.

The output is a FASTA file with extenstion "ust.fa" in the working folder, which is the SPSS representaiton of the input.

If the program is run with the option `-a 1`, then the header line of each sequence will also contain the abundance counts as
in the provided BCALM input file.


## Detailed Usage

In order to build a SPSS representation for your k-mer set, you must first run [BCALM2](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm) on your set of k-mers. BCALM2 will construct a set of unitigs. Those unitigs are then fed as input to `ust`, which outputs a FASTA file with the SPSS representation. Note that the k parameter to `ust` must match the `-kmer-size` used when running BCALM2.

If you would like to store the data on disk in compressed form (like UST-Compress in our paper), you can then install and run [MFCompress](http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/mfcompress/) on the output of UST as follows: `MFCompressC mykmers.ust.fa`

If you would like to build a membership data structure based on UST, then see the [SSHash](https://github.com/jermp/sshash) repository.
